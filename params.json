Using these instructions, I was able to start taking readings from a single ldr within about 2 minutes.\r\n\r\nI used a similar set of instructions for the ds18b20 temperature sensor, using the instructions [here](http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/ds18b20-arduino). Note that it is necessary to install two additional libraries in order to use the ds18b20 with the arduino: the [Dallas Temperature Control Library](http://www.milesburton.com/?title=Dallas_Temperature_Control_Library#One_Wire_Library) and the [OneWire](http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_OneWire.html) library.","google":"UA-61502512-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
