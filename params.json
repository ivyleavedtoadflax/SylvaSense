Using these instructions, I was able to start taking readings from a single ldr within about 2 minutes.\r\n\r\nI used a similar set of instructions for the ds18b20 temperature sensor, using the instructions [here](http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/ds18b20-arduino). Note that it is necessary to install two additional libraries in order to use the ds18b20 with the arduino: the [Dallas Temperature Control Library](http://www.milesburton.com/?title=Dallas_Temperature_Control_Library#One_Wire_Library) and the [OneWire](http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_OneWire.html) library.\r\n\r\n### To do\r\n\r\n* Design circuit for multiple sensors\r\n* incorporate SD card storage\r\n* incorporate realtime clock\r\n* optimise for battery life (Narcolepsy?)\r\n* calculate/trial battery life under different sampling intensity\r\n\r\n### Sources of inspiration\r\n\r\n* [Vinduino academic paper](http://www.academia.edu/10258579/An_Embedded_System_for_Smart_Vineyard_Agriculture)\r\n* [Make your own gypsum soil moisture sensors](http://unpuntilloalambre.blogspot.com.es/2014/01/gypsum-block-for-soil-moisture-sensor.html)\r\n  * These soil DIY soil sensors are gypsum based, and therefore a vast improvement on other sensors I have seen online which are based on electrodes inserted into bare soil. To build you need:\r\n    * [35 mm hair curlers](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/huc/view.html?ie=UTF8&newItems=CVQBVDMCXYT1O%2C1)\r\n    * [M3 threaded rod](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00SJHFUQ0/ref=ox_sc_imb_mini_detail?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A3UZTDMDZ5GUQW)\r\n    * [3D printed caps for the curlers](http://www.thingiverse.com/make:103549). If you have a 3D printer these can be printed by you, otherwise online services exist which can print these for you e.g.:https://www.shapeways.com.\r\n    * Gypsum (plaster of Paris) - [you can make your own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUmtgeGc_JA) or [buy](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Loxley-Plaster-of-Paris-1kg/dp/B002L6RIQK) it - it's not expensive. \r\n* Alternative [soil moisture sensing](http://makezine.com/projects/make-18/garduino-geek-gardening/)\r\n* [More soil moisture sensing](http://www.cheapvegetablegardener.com/how-to-make-cheap-soil-moisture-sensor-2/)\r\n* [Growerbot](http://growerbot.com/)\r\n","google":"UA-61502512-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
